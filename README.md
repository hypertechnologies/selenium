### Different Types of waits in selenium

There are 4 types of waits in selenium -

1. Sleep: This ia very hard wait. Example, `Thread.sleep(5000)`
2. Implicit wait: It is to tell selenium to wait for certain time before it throws exception. 
   Implicit wait is valid for the life of the webdriver.
3. Explicit wait: Explicit wait is to tell the selenium/driver to wait certain time
   until certain condition occurs before throwing the exception.
4. Fluent wait: Fluent wait is to tell the selenium/driver to wait maximum amount of time for certain condition.
